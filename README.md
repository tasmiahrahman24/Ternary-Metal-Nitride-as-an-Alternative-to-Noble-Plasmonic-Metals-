# Ternary-Metal Nitride as an Alternative to Noble Plasmonic Metals

## Objective
The study aims to develop a novel plasmonic refractive index sensor using Ti<sub>x</sub>Sc<sub>(1-x)</sub>N in a Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) configuration. It evaluates the potential of this material to surpass the performance of gold and silver in terms of sensitivity, figure of merit (FOM), and structural stability.

## Methodology
- **Material Selection**: Various ternary nitride systems (e.g., Ti<sub>x</sub>Sc<sub>(1-x)</sub>N) were analyzed for their plasmonic properties. Ti<sub>x</sub>Sc<sub>(1-x)</sub>N was chosen due to its stable cubic rocksalt phase and high surface plasmon quality.
- **Design**: A two-port MIM structure was optimized through simulations to maximize sensitivity and reduce optical loss.
- **Analysis**: Key metrics, such as sensitivity (in nm/RIU), FOM, and refractive index changes, were calculated using reflectance spectra and validated through theoretical modeling.

## Key Findings
- Achieved a record sensitivity of **1791.35 nm/RIU** and a FOM of **32.21 RIU\(^{-1}\)**.
- Demonstrated Ti<sub>x</sub>Sc<sub>(1-x)</sub>N's superior performance compared to both noble metals and other ternary nitrides, particularly in the near-infrared spectrum.
- Established the material's CMOS compatibility and stability under diverse environmental conditions.

## Applications
- **Air Pressure Sensing**: Delivered a pressure sensitivity of **3.688 nm/MPa**, proving effective for industrial and environmental monitoring.
- **Biosensing**: Successfully detected minute refractive index changes linked to malaria infection stages, with a sensitivity of **816.67 nm/RIU**, enabling precise non-invasive diagnostics.

## Significance
The study lays the foundation for utilizing ternary nitrides as a new class of plasmonic materials, offering enhanced performance, broader applicability, and seamless integration with existing semiconductor technologies. This advancement has far-reaching implications for nanophotonics, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics.
